        <h2>Ideas are the lifeblood of creativity</h2>
        <p>As graphic designers we find that behind every project there are countless sketches and renderings created during the design process. At times, an initial design might contain ideas that are ahead of their time or too ambitious to be realized when first conceived. So when we expanded our client roster to include more distilleries, we searched our own archives to create a spirits brand that would demonstrate our capabilities. Hairy Antler is that project.</p>
        <p>From naming to branding and packaging—Hairy Antler is steeped in the traditions of pre-Prohibition branding and advertising. In contrast to a name that is wild and untamed, the ornately patterned labels evoke the refined tastes of an Edwardian gentleman. The angled placement on the apothecary-style bottle ensures the brand stands out on the shelf, while each spirit is uniquely distinguished by its own color. The result captures both the heritage and untamed spirit of Kentucky.</p>
        <p>As we continued to develop Hairy Antler, it became clear that a digital presence would be the natural next step in extending the brand. A website would not only serve as a platform for storytelling but also reflect the same attention to detail and craftsmanship that defines the brand. Just as the label design combines tradition with innovation, this website was crafted to echo that balance. With its bold visuals and immersive content, the website brings the Hairy Antler story to life online, allowing the brand to connect with a broader audience while preserving the spirit of Kentucky’s rich history. It’s a modern extension of the brand’s legacy—untamed, yet refined, in the digital world.</p>
